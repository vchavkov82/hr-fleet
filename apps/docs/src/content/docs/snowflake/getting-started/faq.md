## Core FAQs

### Are Snowflake v2 APIs supported?

Yes, the LocalStack for Snowflake supports the Snowflake v2 SQL API (`/api/v2/*` endpoints), as well as the legacy v1 SQL API (which is still being used by a large portion of Snowflake client libraries and SDKs) 

### Why are my Snowflake tests failing?

LocalStack for Snowflake is now GA. If your tests are failing, it could be due to a lack of support for certain Snowflake features. We recommend checking the [function coverage](/snowflake/sql-functions/) to see the list of supported SQL functions and [feature coverage](/snowflake/features/) to see the list of supported features. If you encounter any issues, you can connect with us for [support](#support-faqs).

### Why does the LocalStack for Snowflake run on `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud`?

The LocalStack for Snowflake operates on `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud`. This is a DNS name that resolves to a local IP address (`127.0.0.1`) to make sure the connector interacts with the local APIs. In addition, we also publish an SSL certificate that is automatically used inside LocalStack, in order to enable HTTPS endpoints with valid certificates.

Note: In case you are deploying the LocalStack for Snowflake in a Kubernetes cluster or some other non-local environment, you may need to add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` file of any client machine or Kubernetes pod that attempts to connect to the LocalStack for Snowflake pod via the `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` domain name.

## Integration FAQs

### Why are my CI pipelines failing with `license.not_enough_credits` error?

If you are using the LocalStack for Snowflake in your CI pipelines consistently, you may encounter the `license.not_enough_credits` error. This error occurs when the LocalStack for Snowflake is unable to process the requests due to the lack of LocalStack CI credits.

A CI key allows you to use LocalStack in your CI environment. Every activation of a CI key consumes one CI credit. This means that with every build triggered through the LocalStack container you will consume one credit. To use more credits, you can [contact us](https://localstack.cloud/contact) to discuss your requirements.

### How do I enable detailed debug logs?

You can set the `SF_LOG=trace` environment variable in the Snowflake container to enable detailed trace logs that show all the request/response message.

When using `docker-compose` then simply add this variable to the `environment` section of the YAML configuration file.
If you're starting up via the `localstack start` CLI, then make sure to start up via the following configuration: 

```bash
DOCKER_FLAGS='-e SF_LOG=trace' DEBUG=1 localstack start --stack snowflake
```

### The `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` hostname doesn't resolve on my machine, what can I do?

On some systems, including some newer versions of MacOS, the domain name `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` may not resolve properly.
If you are encountering network issues and your Snowflake client drivers are unable to connect to the emulator, you may need to manually add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
127.0.0.1	snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud
```
